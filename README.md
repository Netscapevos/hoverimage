# hoverimage

This is an image hover effect i created using html  and css only.
The way it works is you hover your cursoer over one of the images and then the image expands
the images are clipped into various polygons thats why it appears as a collage but once you hover over it  it expands to its full form

Nb: I dont own this images 
 also thanks to this guy here whose tutorial i followed to make this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miVfk-q3Mso&list=PLSDeUiTMfxW7lm7P7GZ8qtNFffHAR5d_w&index=5
